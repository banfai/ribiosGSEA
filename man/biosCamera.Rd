\usage{
biosCamera(y, index, design = NULL, contrast = ncol(design),
  weights = NULL, geneLabels = NULL, use.ranks = FALSE,
  allow.neg.cor = FALSE, trend.var = FALSE, sort = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a numeric matrix of log-expression values or log-ratios of expression values, or any data object containing such a matrix. Rows correspond to probes and columns to samples. Any type of object that can be processed by getEAWP is acceptable.}

\item{index}{an index vector or a list of index vectors. Can be any vector such that y[index,] of statistic[index] selects the rows corresponding to the test set. The list can be made using \code{ids2indices}.}

\item{design}{Design matrix}

\item{contrast}{contrast of the linear model coefficients for which the test is required. Can be an integer specifying a column of design, or else a numeric vector of same length as the number of columns of design.}

\item{weights}{numeric matrix of observation weights of same size as \code{y}, or a numeric vector of array weights with length equal to \code{ncol(y)}, or a numeric vector of gene weights with length equal to \code{nrow(y)}.}

\item{geneLabels}{Labels of the features in the input matrix}

\item{use.ranks}{do a rank-based test (TRUE) or a parametric test (FALSE)?}

\item{allow.neg.cor}{should reduced variance inflation factors be allowed for negative correlations?
## @param inter.gene.cor numeric, optional preset value for the inter-gene correlation within tested sets. If NA or NULL, then an inter-gene correlation will be estimated for each tested set.}

\item{trend.var}{logical, should an empirical Bayes trend be estimated? See \code{eBayes} for details.}

\item{sort}{logical, should the results be sorted by p-value?

The function was adapted from \code{\link[limma]{camera}}, with following improvments
\enumerate{
  \item The output data.frame is more user-friendly
  \item The column 'FDR' is always present, even when only one gene-set was tested
  \item Scores are calculated, defined as \code{log10(pValue)*I(directionality)}, where \code{I(directionality)} equals \code{1} if the directionality is \code{Up} and \code{-1} if the directionality is \code{Down}
  \item Contributing genes and statistics are printed
}}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one row per set and the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{GeneSet}{Gene set name}
  \item{NGenes}{Number of genes in the set}
  \item{Correlation}{Estimated correlation}
  \item{Direction}{Direction of set-wise regulation, \code{Up} or \code{Down}}
  \item{Score}{Gene-set enrichment score, defined as \code{log10(pValue)*I(directionality)}, where \code{I(directionality)} equals \code{1} if the directionality is \code{Up} and \code{-1} if the directionality is \code{Down}}
  \item{ContribuingGenes}{A character string, containing all genes labels of genes that are in the set and regulated in the same direction as the set-wise direction, and the respective statistic}
}
}
\description{
An adapted and enhanced version of limma::camera
}
\note{
Since limma 3.29.6, the default setting of allow.neg.cor changes from TRUE to FALSE, and a new parameter, inter.gene.cor, is added with the default value of 0.01, namely a prior inter-gene correlation is set for all gene sets. Currently, \code{biosCamera} does not have  the parameter \code{inter.gene.cor}, but \code{allow.neg.cor} is set by default to \code{FALSE} to be consistent with the latest camera function.

\examples{
y <- matrix(rnorm(1000*6),1000,6)
design <- cbind(Intercept=1,Group=c(0,0,0,1,1,1))
# First set of 20 genes are genuinely differentially expressed
index1 <- 1:20
y[index1,4:6] <- y[index1,4:6]+1
# Second set of 20 genes are not DE
index2 <- 21:40
biosCamera(y, index1, design)
biosCamera(y, index2, design)
# compare with the output of camera: columns 'GeneSet', 'Score', 'ContributingGenes' are missing, and in case \\code{inter.gene.cor} is (as default) set to a numeric value, the column 'Correlation' is also missing
